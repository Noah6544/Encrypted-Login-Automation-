# Encrypted-Login-Automation-
this is a script that I'm making in order to automatically sign in and out of spotify, discord, and google while encrypting the passwords and storing them on your pc. I'm trying to structure it so that it can be easily expanded when I have other sites to sign into.  
# How to automate:
## Steps (wip)
1) Key Generation
3) Password encryption
4) Setting up clicks
## VERSION
### Some number of commit (429/2021)
- Added three steps which are hopefully going be easier to follow. added some rough instruction in each file. bored in class.
## Completed
- I've managed to encrypt strings, store them on pc, decrypt bytes, convert to string, print out as text. 
- Managed to sign into discord and out of discord and ou of google autonomously. 
- Made 3 steps to hopefully make this easier for someone who might want to do this but doesn't know how to code.
- stop playing playing rocket league. finish this instead 
- - i actually did it. but subnautica is the problem now
### From ToDo list:
- make a .py file for each step, because you'll end up encrypting multiple times if you are running the same file. I'm also trying to make this accesible for people who don't wanna have to read and understand the code.
-  Because I'm having trouble wrapping my head around making the files, opening the files, generating a key (making sure not to run it more than once to avoid generating a key that doesn't work for a password), I'm instead going to try to make diffferent .py files. Each labeled a different step with instructions on how to use each. This is supposed to be helpful for anyone wanting to create encrypted passwords without having to do much.


## Issues
- Sometimes the discord clicks register to logout and sometimes it doesnt. Right now the fix is just to increase the time.sleep() to a little more just in case it was clicking too fast, which is working.
- When trying to sign out, in this order: discordout(); googleout(), Google opens up before discord. Not sure why. hopefull will fix later. This is a personal project mainly and Im just posting for ego and im bored. so im not really trying to fix this as a program to be used by a lot of people.
## ToDo
- ## Improve the instructions. This might have to be done in a youtube video but I dont want to get copyright striked again for making a tutorial for a coding thing. They said that I was taking advantage of people which idk. 
- ### Add instructions to the readme.
- ### Make the readme cleaner.
- fix a lot of things. 
- stop playing playing subnautica. you go too slow cuz ur so scared. u have 30 hours and just getting to build the prawn. 
- scan the reaper leviathan. if you're gonna use the stasis rifle to freeze him. do not go for his face. he can still get you. learned from experience
